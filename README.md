3. Install puppeteer package:

# Possible better solutions compared with current feasibility
1. The current code of Swap.defillama.com doesn't have unique identifiers, classes, names making it tough to add some features which need unique identifiers/selectors.
2. The options of the dropdowns are not created using the suggested <option> tags making it unfeasible to use ideal functions like .select .

# Note: The commented code in intro.js is the code format that can be used if unique identifiers are given to dropdown options (by replacing with correct selectors).
